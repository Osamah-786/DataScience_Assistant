# DataScience_Assistant
📊 Data Science Assistant
This project is a Data Science Assistant built using Agentic AI
It uses multiple AI models instead of a single model
Each model is responsible for a specific data science task
The system works like a virtual data science team

🎯 Purpose of the Project
To simplify the data science workflow
To help students and beginners perform:
Data exploration
Data analysis
Statistical analysis
Visualization
Report generation
To show how GenAI + Data Science can work together

🧠 How It Works (Simple Explanation)
The system uses multiple AI agents
Each agent has a fixed role
One Team Leader AI silently coordinates all agents
User only sees the final answer, not the internal process

🤖 AI Models Used
Llama 3.1 (8B) → Team Leader (controls everything)
Llama 3.2 (3B) → Data discovery (fast file reading)
Qwen 2.5 (14B) → Heavy data analysis
Mistral (7B) → Statistical calculations
Qwen 2.5 (7B) → Charts and reports

📌 What This Assistant Can Do
